Golf de los SÃ¡bados is a private project that aims to code an application that can track weekly tournament results specifically for the Cumbres de Santa Fe Golf Club in Mexico City. The app should be able to store each player's score, keep track of entry fees, award prices to both the winner and the second place, and award a Worst Player trophy to the worst score each Saturday. The app should also be able to display a leaderboard, which resets on a yearly basis.

Since this app should be downloadable on both the App Store and Google Play.
